This Folder contains the modified mapper & driver code to be able to control 4 lights which are present at location "building1/floor1" 


This mapper also updates the actual value of the lights after changing the expected value and turning the light ON/OFF

// FixMe : The current directory structure of DeviceCertification may not be completely correct & may need to be changed
